# Hopfield-Network
A Hopfield network is a form of recurrent artificial neural network popularized by John Hopfield in 1982, but described earlier by Little in 1974. Hopfield nets serve as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes.

Current State : Weight matrix is calculated. Stability tests are made. Program has a small gui with 3 vectors with 3x1 dimensions, 3x3 weight matrix and outputs for stability results.

To run program you need to install python3, pytq5 for python3 and numpy.

To install in Gnome terminal write: 
    
    For python3: 
        sudo apt-get install python3
    For PyQt5:
        sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
    For numpy:
        sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
        
To start tests:

    python3 main.py
